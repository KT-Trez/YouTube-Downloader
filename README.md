# YouTube Downloader
Desktop, electron based app, to download videos from [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/).

# Download
To download an app, visit [releases](https://github.com/KT-Trez/yt_downloader/releases) page and select adequate installer.

# Usage
### Download Tab
1. Search for videos using keywords from title ex.: `never gonna give you up`
2. Chose the video and click its download icon to open download menu
   - Simple download
     1. Scroll through the list of available formats and chose one for yourself 
     2. Click on the download button next to your desired format
   - Advanced download
     1. Toggle advanced mode with â‹¯ button in the top-right corner of download menu
     2. Chose one audio and one video format that will be merged together. Select them by toggling corresponding sliders
     3. Press `ADVANCED DOWNLAOD` button above formats section

> **Warning**  
> `Advanced download` uses [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) to merge audio and video, which is a CPU heavy task.  
> Consider this when downloading more than one video simultaneous or using lower-end computers and laptops.
> 
> Additionally, merging not always is perfect and some de-sync between audio and video may occur.

### Queue Tab
Check progress of videos download.  
Progress consist of three parts, but not all of them must be present on selected format:
- Audio - audio's download progress
- Video - video's download progress
- Merge - merging audio with video progress (_advanced mode function_)

### Downloaded Tab
Browse your downloaded audio and video files. You can delete them or play using system build-in media player.  
To view downloads directly in directory, press folder icon next to the `Open in directory` inscription.
